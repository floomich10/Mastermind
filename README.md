# Mastermind

Key points:

- The application should use a mastermindGame class, which has
a constructor with parameters for the number of pegs in the code (1 to 10) and the number of colors for
the pegs (1 to 9).
- For example, if the code is 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the guess
is 2 1 1 2 2 2, then the mastermindGame object should only report two correct colors (a single 1 and a
single 2).

From the textbook:

The game of Mastermind is played as follows: One player (the code maker) chooses a secret arrangement of colored pegs and the other player (the code breaker) tries to guess it. For each guess, the code
breaker puts forth an arrangement of colored pegs, and the code maker reports two numbers:
  1. The number of pegs that are the correct color and in the correct position.
  2. The number of pegs that are the correct color regardless of whether they are in the
     correct position.
     
Create a Mastermind application that plays the game of Mastermind with the computer as the code
maker and the user as the code breaker. The application should use a mastermindGame class, which has
a constructor with parameters for the number of pegs in the code (1 to 10) and the number of colors for
the pegs (1 to 9). The secret code generated by a mastermindGame object can contain duplicate colors.
For example, a 5-peg code could be 1 2 2 5 6. A guess with duplicates will require extra attention when
counting the number of pegs of the correct color. For example, if the code is 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the guess
is 2 1 1 2 2 2, then the mastermindGame object should only report two correct colors (a single 1 and a
single 2). Application output should look similar to:
